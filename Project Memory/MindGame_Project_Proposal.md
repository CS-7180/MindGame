# MindGame (Pre-Game Mental Routine Builder for Peak Athletic Performance)

**Members:** @Raj Laskar, @Vineela Goli

**Description:** Athletes at all levels often neglect mental preparation despite its proven impact on performance. MindGame is a full-stack web app that helps amateur and college athletes build and track personalized pre-game mental routines using techniques like visualization, breathing, and affirmations. Users can define their own routines or get suggestions from a rule-based recommender system that matches them to curated templates based on their sport and anxiety patterns — no AI dependency. Post-game reflections help surface correlations between routine adherence and performance over time.

## User Personas
* The College Athlete - deals with pre-game nerves, no access to a sports psychologist
* The Recreational Player - inconsistent performance, suspects mindset is a factor
* The Amateur Coach - wants to introduce mental prep to their team
